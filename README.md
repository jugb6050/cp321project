^Github was used to store files, as well as the csv and geojson to avoid any cors access issues
-I have attached the files such as the csv and geojson used only for checking by t/a. 
-However the project should run only with index.html file, as the csv and geojson is accessed
through github.
-CSV was combined for north and south america data, as instructed per assignment outline
-geojson was generated, for only North and South American Countries
